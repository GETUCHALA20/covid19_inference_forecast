# Covid-19 inference and forecast

We attempt to model the spread of Covid-19. 


The current paper draft (as of 2020-04-01) can be downloaded [from the repo.](https://github.com/Priesemann-Group/covid19_inference_forecast/raw/master/paper_draft_2020-04-01.pdf)

The current research article (a short version) [is also available.](https://github.com/Priesemann-Group/covid19_inference_forecast/raw/master/paper_overview_2020-04-01.pdf)

The code used to produce the figures is available [here](https://github.com/Priesemann-Group/covid19_inference_forecast/blob/master/Corona_germany_simple_model.ipynb) (simple model) and [here](https://github.com/Priesemann-Group/covid19_inference_forecast/blob/master/Corona_germany_current_forecast_with3scenarios.ipynb) (with change points).
It is runnable in Google Colab. Requirements are PyMC3 >= 3.7

Some output figures are shown below. The rest are found in the figures folder. We update them regularly.
